# Jate: Just Another Text Editor

To whoever is grading this challenge: I know that it is a hot mess. I would love to get advice on how to fix some problems in here, or what the names of things I should be looking up to know what i'm doing are. I'm getting 404 errors with the src-sw.js file and, to be honest, I've used too much of my time trying to figure it out. I'm struggling to understand the material and my tutoring session has been moved to next week. Thanks for your help.

Most of the code here has been edited from the assignments.
